## How it works
Simply put in your plans for each hour, and save those plans by clicking the button on the right of each text box. 

## Languages used
The HTML and CSS was almost complete, so I didn't write much in those languages. I wrote mostly in jQuery.
### HTML
I created the time blocks with html.
### CSS
I fixed some positioning with css. 
### jQuery/Javascript
I wrote the saving function, block color change depending on time of day, and local storage items with jQuery.

## Tech used from others
The index.html and style.css was given and all but complete. On top of that these were all used within.
